## THE FRENCH DISPATCH

##### Inspired in the Wes Anderson most recent movie "The French Dispatch"

### It began as holiday. Arthur Howitzer, Jr., college freshman, eager to escape a bright future on the Great Plans, convinced his father, proprietor of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun, to fund his transatlantic passage as an educational opportunity to learn the family business through the production of a series of travelogue columns to be published for local readers in the Sunday Picnic magazine.
